Base Level Extension

This plugin adds a transcript box (with search) to all LectureOnline and TowerLA lectures from UT Austin! Studying has never been easier.

For some courses, the website may block the transcript. For these, there will be a button that appears to open the video in a new tab that allows the transcript!

## Built with WXT + TS + SolidJS
